Create a login system in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Acceptance Criteria:
The system prompts a message asking the user to input the password.
The correct password value is 123456789.
If the user enters the wrong password, display an error message "Wrong Password!" and re-ask the user to input the password.
If the user enters the correct password, display a welcoming message "Welcome to the system!" and end the program.
Limit login attempts:
Allow the user only 3 attempts to input the correct password.
If the user exceeds 3 wrong attempts, display a message "Too many failed attempts. Access locked!" and end the program.
OOP Requirements:
Use a class named LoginSystem to handle password operations.
